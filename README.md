# Violine

This repository contains a small React tool for hearing the open-string notes of a violin (G, D, A and E). The application uses the Web Audio API to play each note when you click on its button.

## Usage

Open `violin-tuner/index.html` in a modern web browser. Each button will play a sine tone for the corresponding string.

## Mobile version

The `violin-mobile` folder contains a simple React Native example with a home page, about page, contact page and history page. The app uses `react-navigation` for screen transitions and demonstrates how a mobile version might look.
